## üíæ Installation

Install the plugin via <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/">Yarn</a> (recommended)

```
yarn add serverless-appsync-plugin
```

or via <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install">NPM</a>

```
npm install serverless-appsync-plugin
```
### Configuring the plugin

Add ```serverless-appsync-plugin``` to the plugins section of ```serverless.yml```

```
plugins:

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### `serverless deploy`

This command will deploy all AppSync resources in the same CloudFormation template used by the other serverless resources.

## üìù Notes

* If you are planning on using <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service">AWS Elastic Search</a>, you will need to create an Elastic Search domain/endpoint on AWS and set it as the ```endpoint``` option in  ```serverless.yml``` **before** deploying.
* When writing custom mapping-templates, try using `.vtl` over `.txt` (e.g. `getUser-request-mapping-template.vtl`). Then try out the [vscode-velocity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sodatea.velocity) plugin for the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor which will give you `syntax highlighting`.

## üë∑ Migration from versions prior to 1.0
<a id="cfn-migration"></a>

If you have previously used versions of this plugin prior to 1.0, you will need
to perform some additional manual steps in order to continue use of this
plugin (it will be worth it).  This change removes the `sls *-appsync`
commands in favor of adding AppSync resources directly to the serverless
cloudformation stack. What this means for your existing APIs is that
they can no longer be updated.  The good news is that you will
no longer need to use separate commands to deploy vs update and update
your serverless config with the created `apiId`.

The rough steps for migration are as follows:
1. Run `sls deploy` to create the new AppSync api and make note
of the endpoint returned as part of the stack outputs. *If you were
using an `API_KEY` auth type, you will also need the new api key which
is also included in the stack outputs.*
2. Update existing consumers of your API to use the new endpoint. *If
you're using an api key, this will also need updated*
3. After verifying all existing consumers are updated, run `sls delete-appsync`
to cleanup the old resources
4. Remove the `apiId` line from `custom.appSync` in `serverless.yml`
5. üçπ
