## ▶️ Usage

### `serverless deploy`

This command will deploy all AppSync resources in the same CloudFormation template used by the other serverless resources.

### `serverless graphql-playground`

This command will start a local graphql-playground server which is connected to your AppSync endpoint. The required options for the command are different depending on your AppSync authenticationType.

For API_KEY, either the GraphQLApiKeyDefault output or the --apiKey option is required

For AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS, the -u/--username and -p/--password arguments are required. The cognito user pool client id can be provided with the --clientId option or directly in the yaml file (```custom.appSync.userPoolConfig.playgroundClientId```)

For OPENID_CONNECT, the --jwtToken option is required.

The AWS_IAM authenticationType is not currently supported.

## 📝 Notes

* If you are planning on using <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service">AWS Elastic Search</a>, you will need to create an Elastic Search domain/endpoint on AWS and set it as the ```endpoint``` option in  ```serverless.yml``` **before** deploying.

## 👷 Migration from versions prior to 1.0
<a id="cfn-migration"></a>

If you have previously used versions of this plugin prior to 1.0, you will need
to perform some additional manual steps in order to continue use of this
plugin (it will be worth it).  This change removes the `sls *-appsync`
commands in favor of adding AppSync resources directly to the serverless
cloudformation stack. What this means for your existing APIs is that
they can no longer be updated.  The good news is that you will
no longer need to use separate commands to deploy vs update and update
your serverless config with the created `apiId`.

The rough steps for migration are as follows:
1. Run `sls deploy` to create the new AppSync api and make note
of the endpoint returned as part of the stack outputs. *If you were
using an `API_KEY` auth type, you will also need the new api key which
is also included in the stack outputs.*
2. Update existing consumers of your API to use the new endpoint. *If
you're using an api key, this will also need updated*
3. After verifying all existing consumers are updated, run `sls delete-appsync`
to cleanup the old resources
4. Remove the `apiId` line from `custom.appSync` in `serverless.yml`
5. 🍹
